## Download multiple
If you want to download a whole album, then you'll want a spotify developer token/credentials (google it, it's not hard to). Also you'll need the spotify album id.
That should be about it, just run the multi.py file.
Oh you'll need to install the pip dependencies (at the top of the python file) too.
